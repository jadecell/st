# This is my build of st for everyone to use

**To Build for the newbs**

**NOTE**
You need to install powerline fonts from [this repo](https://github.com/powerline/fonts)

*Installing the actual terminal*

```
git clone https://gitlab.com/jadecell/st.git
cd st
sudo make install

```

I can try to help as much as I possible can with support but don't expect anything from me.

**Enjoy**
